<p>
	Like most design systems, SKY UX follows a roughly atomic-design structure where basic elements are combined and composed into larger constructs.
</p>
	
<p>
	However, the primary use cases we support lead to an important distinction - SKY UX is much more prescriptive than other design systems you may have used before. The majority of our consumers are building within the Blackbaud ecosystem, and as such we define more rigorous guidelines to help ensure a cohesive experience for our customers.
