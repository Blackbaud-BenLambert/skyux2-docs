		<stache-tutorial-step-heading>Grab the <a stacheRouterLink="/design/prototyping-resources">prototyping kit</a> of your choice</stache-tutorial-step-heading>
		<stache-tutorial-step-body>
			<p>We provide prototyping kits for Sketch and Axure. Since you'll probably want to start playing around with designs as you go through the rest of the resources, you might as well install the kits up front!</p>

		<stache-tutorial-step-heading>Look over the list of <a stacheRouterLink="/components">components</a></stache-tutorial-step-heading>
		<stache-tutorial-step-body>
			<p>You won't be able to absorb all the components right now, but looking over what's available will be helpful as you read through design guidelines.</p>

		<stache-tutorial-step-heading>Read through the <a stacheRouterLink="/design/guidelines">design guidelines</a></stache-tutorial-step-heading>
		<stache-tutorial-step-body>
			<p>Design guidelines are what set SKY UX apart from other design systems. We work hard to provide our customers with a cohesive experience. If you're designing for the Blackbaud ecosystem, following the guidelines will ensure that your application fits right in. Even if you aren't designing for the Blackbaud ecosystem, the guidelines will still help you provide a good user experience.</p>

		<stache-tutorial-step-heading>Work through a <a stacheRouterLink="/design/tutorials">tutorial</a> or two</stache-tutorial-step-heading>
		<stache-tutorial-step-body>
			<p>The tutorials present a scenario and walk through a reference design for that scenario, highlighting the important choices made for the design. While there's no single right answer, it'll be valuable to compare your design choices to the reference design.</p>

			<p>Once you get into the details of your designs you'll be referring back to <a stacheRouterLink="/design/guidelines">guideline</a>, <a stacheRouterLink="/components">component</a>, and <a stacheRouterLink="/styles">style</a> documentation pretty frequently (at least until you've internalized everything). You might want to bookmark those pages for quick reference.</p>
