  <p>
    SKY UX layouts use a <a routerLink="/components/fluid-grid">fluid grid</a> system that can respond as the size of devices or viewports change. Our grid columns have 15px in padding on both sides to create 30px gutters between columns and 15px gutters at the edges of the grid. The columns are fluid, but the gutters remain constant.
  </p>
  <p>
    This grid system allows for a variety of page layouts but still conforms to our design and coding standards.
